A) The largest correlation for survivors is an inverse relationship of -0.22 between serum sodium and serum creatinine.
B) The smallest correlation for survivors is an inverse relationship, -0.0025, between serum sodium and creatinine phosphokinase.
C) The largest correlation for the deceased is a direct relationship of 0.15 betweem serum sodium and creatinine phosphokinase.
D) The least significant correlation for the deceased as an inverse relationship, -0.029 between serum creatinine and platelets.
E) The results are not the same. In fact, the largest correlation for the dead was the smallest for survivors. This could mean it is a leading indicator for death.
The smallest for the dead and the largest for the survivors were unrelated.
