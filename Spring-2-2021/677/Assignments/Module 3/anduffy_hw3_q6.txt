1.
No Variance: 0.8206997084548104
No Skewness: 0.8935860058309038
No Kurtosis: 0.8731778425655976
No Entropy: 0.9810495626822158
2. None of these display an increase in accuracy. No entropy stays consistent,
however.
3. Removing variance registered the greatest loss in accuracy.
4. Once again, removing entropy led to no loss in accuracy.
5. Entropy leaving no negative changes and, of the ones that did lose accuracy,
skewness leaving the smallest change is consistent with k-NN. However, k-NN's
largest drop in accuracy was from the removal of kurtosis, not variance.
