2. It appears that the error rate is constant.
k-NN Accuracies:
	True Positives: 384
	False Positives: 0
	True Negatives: 301
	False Negatives: 1
	True Positive Rate: 0.9974025974025974
	True Negative Rate: 1.0
	Accuracy: 0.9985422740524781
4. Using the k-NN system, we achieve a near perfect accuracy, so this is the
preferred system.
5. This would be Variance = 7, Skewness = 1, Kurtosis = 1, Entropy = 8, and my
classifier would mark this as a bad bill, but the k-NN would mark it as good.
