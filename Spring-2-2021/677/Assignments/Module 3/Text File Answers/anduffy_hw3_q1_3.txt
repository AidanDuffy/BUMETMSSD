Looking at the averages for each category, it is clear that regardless of class,
entropy will be negative. Additionally, kurtosis always appears to be positive.
On the other hand, the variance and skewness categories appear to be positive
for green and negative for reds. Finally, I noticed that the standard deviation
was constant for all four functions when accounting for both reds and greens.
