No Variance: 0.9868804664723032
No Skewness: 0.9883381924198251
No Kurtosis: 0.9839650145772595
No Entropy: 1.0

2. This means that all eliminating entropy actually allows for perfect accuracy!
Removing any another slightly lower the efficacy of the model.
3. Removing kurtosis led to the largest decrease in accuracy.
4. Entropy's removal also led to the smallest change in accuracy as well as
decrease (since it increased).
