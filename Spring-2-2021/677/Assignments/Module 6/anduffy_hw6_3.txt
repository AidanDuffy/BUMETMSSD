I ran this several times to examine multiple graphs. Unsurprisingly, the higher
the width, the higher the perimeter as well as the area. Additionally, there was
a direct correlation between groove length and length. However, when compactness
vs assymetry was selected, the graph indicated almost no correlation between the
two. One interesting pattern was compactness vs area, where a low compactness
meant a low area, but as we got to medium and high compactness, almost all of
the correlation was lost.

After running this several times, the accuracy of the system wild quite significantly,
going as low as 3% and as high as 87%.

Generally speaking, upon several runnings of the program, this classifier was
consistently less accurate than the earlier use cases.
