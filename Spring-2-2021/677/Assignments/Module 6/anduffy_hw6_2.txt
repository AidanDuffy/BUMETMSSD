This shows that using SVMs delivers more accurate results given a dataset with
several features and a dataset of this size. As noted in the course PDFs, SVMs
struggle with larger datasets and are more computationally intensive in training,
so it would be interesting to experiment there. Even still, kNN was generally
the most accurate of the supervised learning classifiers, so it is bested here.
