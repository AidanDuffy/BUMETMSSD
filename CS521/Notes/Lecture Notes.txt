Module 1:
	Lecture 1:
		-Course Overview
			-6 week of instruction, 1 week for final exam and project
			-basic Python overview
			-this will be made up of simple (non-trivial) examples, like lego blocks
			-everything will be visualized, use pythontutor.com
			-de-emphasized quizzes so you can use it as an indicator of what you need to learn
				-quizzes will ask what is a block of code doing, M.C. about outcomes, and T/F
			-project must be individual, shows you mastered basic python structures ie people have done sports rankings, hangman games, etc.
				-think about project that would help advance my career
		-Python Basics
			-no declaration of storage (no need to set a variable as an integer or even declare it as such) like in Java or C
			-its an interpretive language (runs code line by line) not a compiled lang like Java
			-import libraries, not include, but it is similar
			-5 data types and 5 collections:
				-int, String, boolean, float, etc
				-list, dict, set, etc
	Lecture 2:
		-Python Storage
			- x = 5, y = 5.0, x==y is True because the values are equal but x is y is False because they do not point to the same object
			-object = data + methods that operate on this data
		-Structure
			-English has sentences, building blocks of nouns and verbs, with grammar rules
			-Python has statements, building blocks of data types, and syntax rules
		Data Types
			-integers, floats, boolean, char, complex numbers are the primitives
			-lists [], tuples (), set {x,y}, string, dict {a:b} are the collections
		Modules
			-large programs can be split into modules with variables na d functions
				-modules are stored as files
			-a Py script can import individual programs or all programs within a module import math vs from math import p
